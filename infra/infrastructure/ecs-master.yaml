Description: >

    This template deploys a VPC, with a pair of public and private subnets spread
    across two Availabilty Zones. It deploys an Internet Gateway, with a default
    route on the public subnets. It deploys a pair of NAT Gateways (one in each AZ),
    and default routes for them in the private subnets.

    It then deploys a highly available ECS cluster using an AutoScaling Group, with
    ECS hosts distributed across multiple Availability Zones.

    Finally, it deploys a pair of example ECS services from containers published in
    Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR).
